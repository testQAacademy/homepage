                    <h2>Resume</h2>
                    <p>My name Ryu, I'm a fighter.  After defeating Sagat and M. Bison for the nth time, Iâ€™ve decided to downshift my martial arts career a little bit and get into this IT thing â€• sensei tells me that thereâ€™s a lot of money on the Internet, and a whole lot less getting punched in the face. Iâ€™d like to build a little website to market my personal brand, then maybe sell a few t-shirts, nunchucks, that sort of thing â€• I think itâ€™ll be a big hit.</p>
